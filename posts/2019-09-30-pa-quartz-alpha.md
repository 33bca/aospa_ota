**Quartz New Pussycat?**

Hey all, we’ve been working hard behind the scenes and have several announcements that we are really excited about and feel we are ready to make.

**CypherOS**

As many of you know, the Paranoid Android team is pretty small and we are a close knit group who are very proud of our work. We’ve been constantly on the lookout for more members to join us in our efforts and are happy to welcome the guys at CypherOS to the fold. This collaboration has helped us greatly in getting work done and has enabled us to put our efforts into bringing up our sources and building for Android 10 as soon as the source was made available. We hope you will all welcome them too!

**Quartz going on?**

As soon as the source was dropped for 10 we have been working hard at getting our devices booting. With the added manpower we have been able to do this and are thankful for all the contributions made by the team. With the latest release of Android, Google dropped its naming for deserts. This quirkiness is something that is admired in the Android community and we have taken upon ourselves to continue in the fashion. Many ideas were thrown around by the team and we have decided to go with a theme of rocks and minerals for our future releases. In this case for 10/Q we are going with Quartz. We hope we can continue to have fun with this and have some more surprises along this vein that we’re looking forward to announcing. 

**Apps**

We’re also happy to announce that we are continuing our collaboration with Hampus Olsson and will be including his Abstruct Wallpaper App as our wallpaper picker in our future builds, as well as new wallpapers that will be added on our first stable release. This will provide you with many more choices when customising your homescreen and will include our own wallpapers too.

In addition to this, in future builds we will also be moving to Retro Music Player as our default music player. We love the design aspects of this app and the vast opportunities for personal customisation make it something we are pleased to include in our work. 

**What’s next?**

We hope that the above is all exciting and that you are looking forward to the future as much as we are. With all the help and input from the team we feel we are ready to announce that we are releasing some alpha builds for a few of our devices! We look forward to hearing your feedback and hope that this will help us to improve in our development and we welcome your input on our gerrit. These builds will be released during the next days.

Current devices receiving an alpha build are:

- OnePlus 7 Pro
- OnePlus 6T
- OnePlus 6
- Xiaomi Mi 9T
- Redmi K20
- Xperia Tama Platform
