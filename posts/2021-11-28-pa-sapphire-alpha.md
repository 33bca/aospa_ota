**Sapphire who?**

Hey all, after the Android 12 announcement and recent AOSP code release, we've had put our focus and time on making a Paranoid Android version y'all can enjoy, and we are excited to share you some news about it.

**Paranoid Android Sapphire**

As soon as the Android 12 source was dropped, we have been working hard at getting our devices booting and stable. To continue what we introduced you when we announced Paranoid Android Quartz, this year the mineral we've chosen for this release is Sapphire. This beautiful mineral name will accompany us during this Android 12 cycle. 

**Explanation on Sapphire Alphas**

These last years we have seen quite a confusion when it comes to our Alpha builds, and we want to give a better and proper information about it. Alpha builds are specifically worked by each of our supported devices maintainer. This means the number of alphas each device can get might not match what other devices will have, as Alphas are builds that might have bugs that we want you to help us find and fix, and with that we might have to push more builds for some specific devices.

Regarding to features, Alpha builds might include visual changes or features that might not even make it to Betas or the future Stable build of Paranoid Android. Some of those features are W.I.P, some of them are just temporal try features that we want you all to give your opinion about. Alphas for some devices might have some features others don't, and that's intended and expected at least until our Beta builds are out, where all the devices will have same features at the same time.

**Supported devices**

We hope that the above is all exciting and that you are looking forward to the future as much as we are. To avoid missunderstandings or confusions regarding which devices might get Paranoid Android 12 or not, we wanted to make it easier for you.

We have created a Twitter thread, where you can see all the devices our maintainers are booting, but it won't guarantee they might get support thought most of them will. If you want to know if your device is supported, please take a look at the below link.
