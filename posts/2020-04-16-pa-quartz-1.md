**Quartz you talking about?**

Hey folks! For starters we would like to thank all our users of our alpha and beta builds that we started releasing last year. They have all been amazing and have helped us immensely in our development. Since our initial releases, we’ve been working at a fast pace and feel we now have something that is polished enough to warrant an official release.

As always, you will find the majority of features we have had since our Oreo releases and we will be growing this list with many new and exciting additions in the coming weeks.

**Big Thanks**

Last year, we asked our community if anyone would be interested in becoming developers and device maintainers for Paranoid Android. Gradually, our team has grown and we feel we have now reached a point where we have an incredible team that has the skills and ambition to produce a product that we are all proud to release. We would not have been able to do this without these new members and the core team are extremely grateful for the new life being pumped into the project. We hope to be able to continue to expand our team to support more devices and add new features that enhance user experience. For those interested, please email [herna@paranoidandroid.co][2] , so we can get in contact.

**Release**

Now for the part you’ve all been waiting for. For Oreo and Pie, we released builds that were of alpha and beta quality. We are happy to announce that Quartz will be our first stable release since Nougat. This is the first step for us making Paranoid Android worth putting on your phones and that we are releasing on so many devices at once. We also believe that we are now able to commit to giving Paranoid Android the life it really needs to continue to grow.
