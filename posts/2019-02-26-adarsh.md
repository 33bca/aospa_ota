We are very sorry to have heard the news that Adarsh-MR (Adarsh1998), the founder of Citrus-CAF and Cardinal-AOSP has passed away after recent illness complications.

He was always helpful and humble when it came to his work and his contributions towards the community will be missed by many.

The team at Paranoid Android have been following his work closely for a long time and were excited about the work he was producing. We would like to extend our condolences to all those who knew him personally and those who have worked with him.

As one of his last wishes was to keep his latest project, Citrus-CAF, alive, we would like to ask anyone that has time and can get involved, to reach out his teammates, and bring them some help. We know Adarsh would have loved it.

**Rest in Peace Brother - Hernán Castañón**
