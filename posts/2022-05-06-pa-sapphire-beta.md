**A huge thanks to y'all**

Recently one of our team members reached you all via Twitter updating on the current situation we have been facing for the last 2 years, and your response has been overwhelming. We can't thank you enough for the support you have given us, and we can say, that for now, we will be able to finish for once at all the biggest blocker we've faced since Quartz releases.

As of now, our OTA backend is ready, and we will finish within the next days the OTA app integration, which we will test with you soon in this new Sapphire Betas.

**Paranoid Android Sapphire Beta**

We are happy to announce the start of the releases of our Paranoid Android Sapphire Beta builds. This builds will integrate most of the features we intend to add on the future stable release, while offering the best device side quality and performance with the guarantee of stability for it.

**Explanation on Sapphire Betas**

As the Alphas were, Betas are device based, so it's possible that some devices get more updates than others, based on the need of each maintainer.

For the betas, we will be posting a weekly changelog on our download website, where you will be able to check, based on your Sapphire beta build date, which features are included and which ones are not. The intention behind this is to offer transparency on what's inside each build.

**New download website**

For this iteration, we've worked on a new download website that we hope makes it easier to get our builds from. This website is developer with Material You (aka Material 3) guidelines and we are offering a minimalist and clean UI for you.

On this website you will be able to see the weeklies changelogs, as well as each device changelog, so you are up to date on what's being added on each build.

You will be able to find not only the Beta builds, but the Alphas ones too.

**Supported devices**

Regarding the supported devices, you will be able to keep the track of which devices get them on our Twitter account, or on our official Telegram channel.

On both places we will be posting as soon as the betas and/or beta updates are available for your devices.
