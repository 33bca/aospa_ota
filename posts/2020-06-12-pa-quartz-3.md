**Quartz? Again?**

Today, we are announcing the release of our third stable build of Paranoid Android Quartz. As always, we’ve worked hard to provide a stable experience across our entire device lineup.

**Gratuities are appreciated**

Many months ago, prior to the Quartz 1 release, we asked you, the community, for donations to keep our infrastructure running. As a result of those donations, we have been able to keep the project alive, and we’re very appreciative for support. Many of you have expressed a desire to support us over the past few weeks. While we have not posted a donation link in the past, we feel that now is the time since we have a few releases under our belts. 

Currently, we have enough funds to sustain our current infrastructure for approximately 7 months. We would like to expand our infrastructure to better serve the global community, but due to the low funds we are unable to do so. In particular, we need more build infrastructure so that building for our entire lineup can be much quicker, which will allow us to release more often. We also want to improve distribution of builds for those of you outside of the USA. 

Below you will find a link to our PayPal. We would greatly appreciate any amount you are able to donate so we can continue to provide you with a quality product.
