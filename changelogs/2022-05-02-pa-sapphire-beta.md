### Bye Bye Quartz

Today, we are announcing the fifth and final stable release of Paranoid Android Quartz. This time we’ve worked hard on improving as much as possible our current features, and we are bringing up three new features we feel you might find helpful.

We are releasing our improved version of App Lock (1.1) which will now be more customizable, DC Dimming support with an extensive variety of options, Lockscreen SmartSpace, a new FOD icon and animation, and Ringer Mode Gestures, which will replicate the function that alert slider does in OnePlus for those devices without it, just by tapping volume up button plus power button.

### Welcome Ruby!

After this Quartz 5 release, we are directly jumping to the newest available Android version, 11, which will give life to Paranoid Android Ruby. There might be some cases where small updates will be available to some Quartz devices, but feature and platform development for Quartz will be stopped.

We hope to be able to start sharing Paranoid Android Ruby Alphas in the next few months for select devices. 

### Quartz 5

Now for the part you’ve all been waiting for, our new features list.

For this release we will have the following features:

 - September security patchset.
 - App Locker version 1.1.
 - DC Dimming.
 - Lockscreen SmartSpace.
 - Ringer Mode Gestures.
 - New FOD icon and animation.
 - Permissions Hub.

For those devices that already had Quartz 4, device related changes can be found on the second post of the respective XDA threads.

With this release of Quartz, we are also adding support for:

 - Xiaomi Mi 6X
 - Xiaomi Mi A3
